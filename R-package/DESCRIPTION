Description: Hypothesis tests and sure independence screening (SIS) procedure based on ball statistics, including ball divergence <doi:10.1214/17-AOS1579>, ball covariance, and ball correlation <doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1462709>, are developed to analyze complex data. The ball divergence and ball covariance based distribution-free tests are implemented to examine equality of multivariate distributions and independence between random vectors of arbitrary dimensions. Furthermore, a generic non-parametric SIS procedure based on ball correlation and all of its variants are implemented to tackle the challenge in the context of ultra high dimensional data.
