Description: Ball statistics, including ball divergence, ball covariance, and ball correlation, 
    are developed to make a statistical inference or sure independence screening(SIS) procedure 
    for complex data. Among them, ball divergence and ball covariance are 
    utilized to test equality of multivariate distributions and independence between random vectors 
    of arbitrary dimensions without moment or distrition assumption. 
    Furthermore, a generic non-parametric SIS procedure based on ball correlation and all
    of its variants are implemented to tackle the challenge in the context of ultra high dimensional data.
