* bcor and bcorsis
* *unit test* are needed. (filename test_bcor) 
* A successful pip version. We can use ```pip install Ball``` to install Ball package in another computer.
* Note: 
    - From the [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/456884/extending-python-to-swig-not-to-swig-or-cython) of stackflow, we know that swig is a easy to start method with high cost performance. Hence, we had better write a crude version python with swig.
