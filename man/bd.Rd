\details{
Given the samples not containing missing values, \code{bd} returns sample version of ball divergence.
If we set \code{dst = TRUE}, arguments \code{x}, \code{y} can be a \code{dist} object or a
symmetric numeric matrix recording distance between samples; 
otherwise, these arguments are treated as data.

Ball divergence, introduced by Pan et al(2017), is a new concept to measure the difference 
between two probability distributions in separable Banach space. 
Ball divergence of two probability measures is proven to be zero if and only if they are identical.

The definitions of the sample version ball divergence are as follows.
Given two independent samples \eqn{ \{x_{1}, ..., x_{n}\} } with the associated probability measure \eqn{\mu} and 
\eqn{ \{y_{1}, ..., y_{m}\} } with \eqn{\nu}, where the observations in each sample are \emph{i.i.d}.

Also, let \eqn{\delta(x,y,z)=I(z\in \bar{B}(x, \rho(x,y)))}, 
where \eqn{\delta(x,y,z)} indicates whether \eqn{z} is located in the closed ball \eqn{\bar{B}(x, \rho(x,y))} 
with center \eqn{x} and radius \eqn{\rho(x, y)}. 
We denote:
\deqn{
A_{ij}^{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{u=1}^{n}{\delta(X_i,X_j,X_u)}, \quad A_{ij}^{Y}=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{v=1}^{m}{\delta(X_i,X_j,Y_v)}
}
\deqn{
C_{kl}^{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{u=1}^{n}{\delta(Y_k,Y_l,X_u)}, \quad C_{kl}^{Y}=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{v=1}^{m}{\delta(Y_k,Y_l,Y_v)}
}

\eqn{A_{ij}^X} represents the proportion of samples \eqn{ \{x_{1}, ..., x_{n}\} } located in the 
ball \eqn{\bar{B}(X_i,\rho(X_i,X_j))} and \eqn{A_{ij}^Y} represents the proportion of samples \eqn{ \{y_{1}, ..., y_{m}\} } 
located in the ball \eqn{\bar{B}(X_i,\rho(X_i,X_j))}. 
Meanwhile, \eqn{C_{kl}^X} and \eqn{C_{kl}^Y} 
represent the corresponding proportions located in the ball \eqn{\bar{B}(Y_k,\rho(Y_k,Y_l))}.

we can define sample version ball divergence as:
\deqn{D_{n,m}=A_{n,m}+C_{n,m}}

BD can be generalized to the \emph{K}-sample problem, i.e. if we 
have \eqn{K} group samples, each group include \eqn{n^{(k)}, k=1,...,K} samples, 
then we define sample version generalized ball divergence for \emph{K}-sample as:
\deqn{\sum_{1 \leq k < l \leq K}{D_{n^{(k)},n^{(l)}}}}

See \code{\link{bd.test}} for a test of multivariate independence based on the 
ball divergence.
