Introdution
----------
The fundamental problems for data mining and statistical analysis are:

- Whether distributions of two samples are distinct?

- Whether two random variables are dependent?

Ball Statistics provide solutions for these issues. Moreover, a variable screening (or feature screening) procedure is also implemented to tackle ultra high dimensional data. 

Ball statistic have several advantages:

- It's applicable to univariate and multivariate data in Banach space.

- There is no need for moment assumption, which means that outliers and heavy-tail data are no longer a problem.

- They perform well in many setting without complex adjustments for parameters.
 
Particularly, for two-sample or K-sample problem, Ball Divergence has been proved to cope well for imbalanced data, and Ball Covariance and Ball Correlation work well for detecting the relationship between complex responses and/or predictors, such as shape, compositional as well as censored data.
