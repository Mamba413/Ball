      The ball divergence and ball covariance based distribution-free tests are implemented to examine equality of 
      multivariate distributions and independence between random vectors of arbitrary dimensions. Furthermore, 
      a generic non-parametric SIS procedure based on ball correlation and all of its variants are implemented to tackle 
      the challenge in the context of ultra high dimensional data.""",
