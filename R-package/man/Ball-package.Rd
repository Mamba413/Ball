\title{Ball: Statistical Inference and Sure Independence Screening via Ball Statistics}
\description{
Hypothesis tests and sure independence screening (SIS) procedure based on ball statistics, including ball divergence \doi{10.1214/17-AOS1579}, ball covariance \doi{10.1080/01621459.2018.1543600}, ball correlation \doi{10.1080/01621459.2018.1462709}, and the permutation free procedure for testing \doi{10.1080/01621459.2023.2277417}, are developed to analyze complex data in metric spaces, e.g, shape, directional, compositional and symmetric positive definite matrix data. The ball divergence and ball covariance based distribution-free tests are implemented to detecting distribution difference and association in metric spaces \doi{10.18637/jss.v097.i06}. Furthermore, several generic non-parametric feature selection procedures based on ball correlation, BCor-SIS and all of its variants, are implemented to tackle the challenge in the context of ultra high dimensional data. A fast implementation for large-scale multiple K-sample testing with ball divergence \doi{ 10.1002/gepi.22423} is supported, which is particularly helpful for genome-wide association study.
