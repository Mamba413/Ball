## Ball: Statistical Inference and Sure Independence Screening via Ball Statistics
<!-- [Chinese version](https://gitlab.com/mamba413/Ball/blob/develop_KS_V1.1/README_CN.md) -->

### Introduction
The fundamental problems for data mining and statistical analysis are:

- Whether distributions of two samples are distinct?

- Whether two random variables are dependent?

**Ball** package provides solution for these issues. Moreover, a variables (features) screening procedure also implemented to tackle ultra high dimensional data. The core functions in **Ball** package are: **bd.test**, **bcov.test**, and **bcorsis**.

These functions based on ball statistic have several advantages:

- It's applicable to univariate and multivariate data in banach space.

- There is no need for moment assumption, which means that outliers and heavy-tail data are no longer a problem.

- There is no need for complex adjustments for parameters.
 
Specially, for two-sample or K-sample test, **bd.test** has is proved to cope well for imbalanced data while **bcov.test** and **bcorsis** works well for complex responses and/or predictors, such as censored data and compositional data.     


### Installation        
#### CRAN version         
To install the Ball R package from CRAN, just run:        
```R
install.packages("Ball")
```

#### Github version       
To install the development version from GitHub, run:      
```R
library(devtools)
install_github("Mamba413/Ball", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
*Windows* user will need to install Rtools first.       


### Usage         
Take *iris* dataset as an example to illustrate how to use **bd.test** and **bcov.test** to 
deal with the fundamental problems mentioned above.

#### **bd.test**              
```R
virginica <- iris[iris$Species == "virginica", "Sepal.Length"]
versicolor <- iris[iris$Species == "versicolor", "Sepal.Length"]
bd.test(virginica, versicolor)
```

In this example, **bd.test** examines the assumption that Sepal.Length distributions of versicolor and virginica are equal.

If the assumption invalid, the *p*-value of the **bd.test**  will be under 0.05.

In this example, the result is:

```
	Nonparametric 2-Samples Ball Divergence Test

data:  virginica and versicolor 
number of observations = 100, group sizes: 50 50
replicates = 99
bd = 0.32912, p-value = 0.01
alternative hypothesis: distributions of samples are distinct
```

The R output shows that *p*-value is under 0.05. Consequently, we can conclude that the Sepal.Length distribution of versicolor and virginica are distinct.

#### **bcov.test**        

```R
sepal <- iris[, c("Sepal.Width", "Sepal.Length")]
petal <- iris[, c("Petal.Width", "Petal.Length")]
bcov.test(sepal, petal)
```

In this example, **bcov.test** investigates whether width or length of petal is associated with width and length of sepal. If the dependence really exists, the *p*-value of the **bcov.test** will be under 0.05.

In this example, the result is:

```
	Ball Covariance test of independence

data:  sepal and petal
number of observations = 150
replicates = 99, Weighted Ball Covariance = FALSE
bcov = 0.0081472, p-value = 0.01
alternative hypothesis: random variables are dependent
```
Therefore, the relationship between width and length of sepal and petal is exists.

#### **bcorsis**                   

We simulate a dataset and demonstrate the usage of **bcorsis** function as follow.

```{r}
## simulate a ultra high dimensional dataset:
set.seed(1)
n <- 150
p <- 3000
x <- matrix(rnorm(n * p), nrow = n)
error <- rnorm(n)
y <- 3*x[, 1] + 5*(x[, 3])^2 + error

## BCor-SIS procedure:
res <- bcorsis(y = y, x = x)
head(res[["ix"]], n = 5)
```
      
In this example, the result is :

```
# [1]    3    1 1601   20  429
```
          
The **bcorsis** result shows that the first and the third variable are the two most 
important variables in 3000 explanatory variables which is consistent to simulation settings.
