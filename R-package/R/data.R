#' @details 
#' This meteorological data containing 46 observations on five groups of variables: air temperature, soil temperature, 
#' relative humidity, wind speed as well as evaporation. 
#' Among them, maximum, minimum and average value for air temperature, soil temperature, and 
#' relative humidity are recorded. As regards to wind speed and evaporation, 
#' there are univariate numerical variables. We desire to test the independence of these five 
#' groups of variables.

#' @title Lung cancer genomic data
#' @name genlung
#' @docType data
#' @description Publicly available lung cancer genomic data from the Chemores Cohort Study, containing 
#' the expression levels of mRNA, miRNA, artificial noise variables as well as clinical variables and response.
#' 
#' @details 
#' Tissue samples were analysed from a cohort of 123 patients, who underwent complete surgical resection at the Institut Mutualiste
#' Montsouris (Paris, France) between 30 January 2002 and 26 June 2006. The studied outcome was the "Disease-Free Survival Time".
#' Patients were followed until the first relapse occurred or administrative censoring. In this genomic dataset, 
#' the expression levels of Agilent miRNA probes (\eqn{p=939}) were included from the \eqn{n=123} cohort samples. 
#' The miRNA data contains normalized expression levels. See below the paper by Lazar et al. (2013) and Array Express 
#' data repository for the complete description of the samples, tissue preparation, Agilent array technology, and data normalization. 
#' In addition to the genomic data, five clinical variables, also evaluated on the cohort samples, are included as 
#' continuous variable ('Age') and nominal variables ('Type','KRAS.status','EGFR.status','P53.status'). 
#' See Lazar et al. (2013) for more details. Moreover, we add 1056 standard gaussian variables 
#' which are independent with the censored response as noise covariates. This dataset represents a situation where the number of 
#' covariates dominates the number of complete observations or \eqn{p >> n} case.

#' @details Sand, silt and clay compositions of 39 sediment samples at different water 
#' depth (in meters) in an Arctic lake. The additional feature is a concomitant variable or 
#' covariate, water depth, which may account for some of the variation in the compositions.

#' @description Simulated random vectors following the von Mises-Fisher distribution 
#' with mean direction \eqn{\mu_{x}=(1, 0, 0)} and \eqn{\mu_{y}=(1, 1, 1)}, 
#' and concentration parameter is \eqn{\kappa = 3}.
#' 
#' @details In directional statistics, the von Mises–Fisher distribution 
#' (named after Ronald Fisher and Richard von Mises), is a probability distribution
#' on the \eqn{(p-1)}-dimensional sphere in \eqn{R^{p}}
#' 
#' The parameters \eqn{\mu}, and \eqn{\kappa}, are called the mean direction and concentration
#' parameter, respectively. The greater the value of \eqn{\kappa}, 
#' the higher the concentration of the distribution around the mean 
#' direction \eqn{\mu},. The distribution is unimodal for \eqn{\kappa}, 
#' and is uniform on the sphere for \eqn{\kappa=0}.
