\description{
A meteorological data include 46 records about air, soil, humidity, wind and evaporation.
}
\details{
This meteorological data containing 46 observations on five groups of variables: air temperature, soil temperature, 
relative humidity, wind speed as well as evaporation. 
Among them, maximum, minimum and average value for air temperature, soil temperature, and 
relative humidity are recorded. As regards to wind speed and evaporation, 
there are univariate numerical variables. We desire to test the independence of these five 
groups of variables.
