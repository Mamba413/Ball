Description: Hypothesis tests and sure independence screening (SIS) procedure based on ball 
    statistics, including ball divergence, ball covariance, and ball correlation, 
    are developed to analyze complex data. The ball divergence and ball covariance based distribution-free 
    tests are implemented to examine equality of multivariate distributions and independence 
    between random vectors of arbitrary dimensions. Furthermore, a generic non-parametric SIS 
    procedure based on ball correlation and all of its variants are implemented to tackle the 
    challenge in the context of ultra high dimensional data.
