\description{
Male and female macaque skull data. 7 landmarks in 3 dimensions, 
18 individuals (9 males, 9 females)
}
\details{
In an investigation into sex differences in the crania of a species of 
Macaca fascicularis (a type of monkey), random samples of 9 male and 9 female 
skulls were obtained by Paul Oâ€™Higgins (Hull-York Medical School) (Dryden and Mardia 1993). 
A subset of seven anatomical landmarks was located on each cranium and the three-dimensional (3D) 
coordinates of each point were recorded.
