# Ball 1.3.13
* Fix issues found by the CRAN check.

# Ball 1.3.12
* Add a fast K-sample BD test procedure for category variables, especially the GWAS datasets. 

# Ball 1.3.11
* Update citation information and reference.

# Ball 1.3.10
* Add variance (Chi-square) weight for K-sample Ball Divergence test.
* Refine distance computation

# Ball 1.3.9
* *bcorsis* can conveniently analyze category variables (e.g., GWAS datasets).
* Add permutation-free method for the Ball Divergence and Ball Covariance test (both only for constant weight now).
* Add variance (chi-square) weight for Ball Divergence test.
* Fix potential bugs in R version 4.0

# Ball 1.3.8
* Improve the reproducibility and efficiency of multi-threading and change the default number of threads as the number of CPUs available.
* Improve the computational efficiency of the KBD test.

# Ball 1.3.7
* Modify ambiguous arguments of bcov.test, bd.test, bcorsis
* Modify document

# Ball 1.3.6
* Formula interface for bd.test and bcov.test
* Optimize the package dependency

# Ball 1.3.5
* Faster implementation of mutual independence test
* Multi-thread support for the test of mutual independence
* Modify document

# Ball 1.3.0
* Add a KBD statistic designed for detecting the distribution distinction when a part of group distributions are identical. (setting *kbd.type = "maxsum"*)
* OPENMP based Multi-thread support for KBD
* Optimized OPENMP parallelism

# Ball 1.2.0
* Speed up feature screening.
* Speed up mutual independence test.
* Another K-sample test statistic (setting *kbd.type = "max"*) is implemented. It is good at detecting the distribution distinction when a part of group distributions are identical.
* Add *complete.info* component in the output list of *bcov.test, bd.test* and *bcorsis* such that user not need to re-run them when user want to obtain the test of result of different statistics.

# Ball 1.1.0
* Bug fix
* OPENMP based Multi-thread support for *bd.test* and *bcov.test*
* Speed up feature screening for survival data
* Implement Angular metric for compositional data 

# Ball 1.0.0
* Initial CRAN version
